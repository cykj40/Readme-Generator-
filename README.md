  ## About
  A readme file is a very important component of any project. It is like a book cover or a movie description. It's a preview of your work it could either spark attention in a user or do just the opposite. Therefore having a good quaility readme is essential. The readme generator accomplishes just that it produces a proffesional consistent looking readme everytime.
