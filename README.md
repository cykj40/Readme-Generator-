  ## Description 
  I created a command line readme generator. The terminal will take you through a series of questions about your project. When you are done answering the questions the application will create a proffesional looking readme.md that you could add to your coding project.

  ## About
  A readme file is a very important component of any project. It is like a book cover or a movie description. It's a preview of your work it could either spark attention in a user or do just the opposite. Therefore having a good quaility readme is essential. The readme generator accomplishes just that it produces a proffesional consistent looking readme everytime.
