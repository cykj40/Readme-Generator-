  ## Description 
  I built a back end for a ecommerce site. I took a working express.js api and configured it to use sequelize to interact with a mysql database.

  ## About
  This assigment really does show us the students how valuable sequelize actually is. The command line displayed the code it wrote in sql language and it was a lot and it was all stuff I would have had to write myself if I wasnt using sequelize. Sequelize has it's own complexities but once you get used to it, it's obviuosly the better way to go since we have been learning javascript all along.

  ## Installation
  I dont think you can install it without my mysql password. The only thing you could do is contact me and have me make one for you, for $$ or Join the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and they will teach you how to make one, as well as many other cool things. check out the link below.
